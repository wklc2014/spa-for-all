    <p>Royal Ascot, one of the most prestigious events in the British horse racing calender is to allow men to wear dresses for the first time in a bid to appeal to transgender racegoers, reports the Daily Star.</p>
    <p>And women will also be allowed to come in a tuxedo and a top hat as part of the l new dress code.</p>
    <p>Britain's first transgender jockey Victoria Smith commented: “Racing is really starting to become more accepting of difference, so any changes that help really are welcome.”</p>
    <p>Royal Ascot in Berkshire – which takes place in June – has operated a strict dress code since the early 19th century, dictating that men must wear black or grey morning dress with a waistcoat and tie and that ladies are not allowed to wear strapless and off-the-shoulder dresses, while midriffs have to be covered and fascinators are also banned.</p>
